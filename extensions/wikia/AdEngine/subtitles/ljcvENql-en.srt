00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,850
buy now all viewers of Game of Thrones know the truth about Jon Snow's lineage

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,050
initially thought to be the

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,050
bastard son of Ned Stark it since been revealed that John is actually

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,850
aegon Targaryen

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,250
and as such as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,450
it has been widely

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,350
believed that rhaegar

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,250
Targaryen

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,250
mad with lust is abducted lyanna Stark and steal her away in dorm

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,150
repeatedly

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,550
sexually assaulting her until she eventually

12
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,350
died in childbirth

13
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,050
even when the truth of Johnsburg was unveiled

14
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,150
friends dark you couldn't have known that in fact

15
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,450
rhaegar had an old is

16
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,750
previous marriage to Elia Martell

17
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,450
and legally married lyanna and

18
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,250
secret and the two was actually been in love

19
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,650
it took Samwell tarly's lover Gilly

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,650
absentmindedly

21
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,450
flipping through old

22
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,650
Scrolls in the Citadel to uncover this long hidden

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,250
truth

24
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,950
so Jon Snow is arguably the one person with the most

25
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,850
justifiable claim to the throne of the Seven Kingdoms

26
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,650
what is it a position he never expire too much less want he certainly take it if there are no other choice

27
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,250
but overall it's highly probable that Jon Snow would have no interest in being

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,850
King

29
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,350
and would likely see Power to someone more deserving of the throne

30
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:57,750
someone like Daenerys

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,550
Targaryen

32
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,050
perhaps

33
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,050
Jon Snow has never been portrayed as someone with any Lust For or even interest in power

34
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,450
believing himself to be a bastard all his life he would never have considered it to be something available to him to begin with

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,450
in

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,950
Westeros

37
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,450
bastards have no claim to their fathers land or title

38
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,850
in fact that's

39
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,650
typically

40
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,450
segregated from a

41
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,050
nobleman's true-born

42
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,250
children making the fact that Jon Snow was raised by net alongside the other star children a very rare thing

43
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,650
bastards in Westeros were usually happen to join the Nights Watch and indeed that seem to be with John believe was in store for him as well

44
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,850
when is Uncle benjen himself a swarm member of the Nights Watch

45
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,450
visited Winterfell in the first season

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,350
John

47
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,250
expresses interest in joining

48
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,850
it wasn't just waited in the slightest by Vengeance warning that there was a hard life

49
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,950
during this time at Castle black

50
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,150
Jon Snow more than acquitted

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,950
himself

52
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,050
earning the respect of both the Lord Commander jeor Mormont

53
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,650
as well as most of his brothers the one notable

54
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,850
exception being turn arms alliser Thorne

55
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,050
following Lord Commander Mormont

56
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,650
death

57
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,550
John was elected to be the new Lord Commander but you never seem completely comfortable in the role

58
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,550
after his betrayal in Murder By sworn Brothers he abandoned the Nights Watch

59
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,450
completely saying

60
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,150
I want you to

61
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,050
never been for an increase in

62
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,650
status power

63
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,650
or even for

64
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,150
legitimization from the status of

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,850
bastard

66
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,850
something Stannis Baratheon

67
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,850
offer Daymond John

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,750
refused

69
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,250
to

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,750
enforce

71
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,550
its first encounter in the night King has been only to ensure the survival of

72
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,450
humanity

73
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,150
even after being for Clayton King in the north by his Northern

74
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,950
Brethren.

75
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:24,850
Wednesday's veins

76
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,350
he's my king

77
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,750
from this day

78
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,550
until his

79
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,450
last day

80
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,650
eventually for claiming her to be his Queen

81
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,850
should the nurse discover the truth about his parentage there will no doubt be tension between them

82
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,850
but it's extremely

83
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,850
likely that John would be more than willing to see the power to her

84
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,450
after all he's already

85
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,050
Jon Snow is an honorable man

86
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,250
but he's never been portrayed as one of the last for power you may be the rightful heir to the iron throne

87
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,350
but in all likelihood

88
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,150
John would accept that roll only

89
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,450
grudgingly if it all
