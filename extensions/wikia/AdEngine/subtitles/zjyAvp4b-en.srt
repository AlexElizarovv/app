Daenerys Targaryen

00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:03,850
has all the makings of a great ruler

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,649
perhaps the greatest ruler

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,750
Westeros has ever seen

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,250
Danny has evolved from the meek timid girl she wants was into a beer sometimes

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,549
merciless it's still extremely

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,450
compassionate leader when she first appeared in the series her cruel and abusive

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,450
brother viserys

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,850
overshadowed and manipulated her

10
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,050
marrying her up to the leader of a Savage tribe of Dothraki

11
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:31,250
Warriors in order to secure an army but becerra's is rash

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,650
impulsive and

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,750
petulant Behavior ended when Danny's Dothraki

00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,250
husband call Drogo gave him the crown he so desperately

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,050
wanted following both viserys and drogo's death

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,150
Daenerys is truly been through all manner of

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,750
struggles and managed to come out if not on top then at least

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,850
unbroken and

19
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:59,950
undefeated from being abandoned by drogo's khalasar to virtually dying of thirst and starvation in the red waste

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,150
to being betrayed by her trusted

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,950
bodyguard sir Jorah Mormont

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,250
break of day I'll have your head this morning to slaver's Bay

intelligence

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,850
and she's done this while eating her own callus are comprised of freed slaves

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,250
unsullied Warriors and the few of drogo's khalasar that didn't abandon their Khaleesi

29
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,250
along with her three dragons and the Army she's amassed

30
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,750
Daenerys has proven herself to be a strong and capable

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,649
if

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,350
occasionally

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,250
violent and vengeful leader

she's masterfully managed to build alliances with Tyrion Lannister and Yara Greyjoy

36
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,649
and is set sail across the narrow sea to make her play for the Iron Throne

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,649
not only does Daenerys have a keen military mind she's also

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,550
incredibly

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,649
compassionate

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,350
the abuse she suffered at the hands of her brother has given her in men Sympathy for the downtrodden of the world and she has a

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,450
particularly

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,150
intense

43
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,850
distaste for those who

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,650
enslave

45
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,650
within a Shirley brutal struggle for control of Westeros looming it's anyone's guess who may ultimately

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,650
emerge Victorious

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,250
the given all the hardship she's faced the battle she's already won

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,650
and let's not forget

49
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,650
her three

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,549
dragons Daenerys Targaryen may be the safest bet and most worthy candidate to sit upon the iron throne
