00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:12,600
Twilight wasn't the most social Pony she like to keep to herself and refuse to go to social then

Twilight met and made Pony friends she decided that she likes being social after all

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,000
she has a knack for magic but sometimes she doesn't get to spell right

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,800
this usually leads to disaster

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,599
like the time she cast a spell for the parasprites not eat food
